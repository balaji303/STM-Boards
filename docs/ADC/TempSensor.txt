Temperature (in °C) = {(V SENSE – V 25 ) / Avg_Slope} + 25

Where:

– V 25 = V SENSE value for 25° C

– Avg_Slope = average slope of the temperature vs. V SENSE curve (given in mV/°C or µV/°C)

according to the datasheet of the stm32f407vetx, the voltage at 25degree is 0.76V and the avg_slop is 2.5mV/C
