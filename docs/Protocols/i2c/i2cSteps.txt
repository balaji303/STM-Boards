Steps to be followed in I2C while using STM Boards


1.  Wait till byte transfer finished
2.  Set Start Generation
3.  Wait till start condition is set
       3.1 The device that generates start is Master
       3.2 The device that generates stop is Slave
4.  Data register is loaded with slave address in write mode (<<1)
5.  Wait till address is set
6.  Load status register to a variable
7.  Wait till data register is empty
8.  Load master address to data register
9.  Wait till data register is empty
10. Start Generationn
11. Wait till start bit condition is unset
12. Send slave address to data register in read mode (<<1 | 1)
13. Wait till address is send
14. Enable Acknowledgement
15. Clear the address flag by copying status register to the temp variable
16. Stop generation
17. Data register not empty
18. Get the data from the data register one by one 
19. return 0
